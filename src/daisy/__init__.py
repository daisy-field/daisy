DAISY aims to be an end-to-end framework to design, develop, and execute distributed
intrusion detection systems (IDS) of varying topologies, in an edge-optimized fashion.
All of which is done in python and done generically.

*Basically: You provide the model along some data sources, plus any other customizations
you want done following the defined interfaces, and you are set!*

See the README.md for more information
